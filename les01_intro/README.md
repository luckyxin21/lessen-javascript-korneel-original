## Formatting code

We'll use Prettier to auto format our code.
Create a new file in the root of your project and name it: `.prettierrc`.
Copy following snippet into that file, prettier will automatically use the correct settings.

```json
{
    "semi": true,
    "trailingComma": "all",
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "singleQuote": true
}
```

See https://prettier.io/ for more info.

## Browser

All javascript classes will be about javascript as a client-side language.
More specifically we'll always run our code inside a browser.
